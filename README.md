Inspiration for this setup comes from https://medium.com/@patrick.elmquist/separate-keymap-repo-for-qmk-136ff5a419bd

## Building keymaps

- `make setup` to install the submodules
- `make all` to build keymaps
- `make totem` to build one keymap (in this case the totem)
- `make clean` to clean up repo before committing
